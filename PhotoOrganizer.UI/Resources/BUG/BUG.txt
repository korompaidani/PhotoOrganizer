- exiflib
- langmap
- dispose pattern for backup manager

BUGS:
- dictionary in C:\Users\korom\source\repos\PhotoOrganizer\PhotoOrganizer.FileHandler\DirectoryReader.cs
should be nulled
- At create backup not the last saved items is written to file but (maybe repo must be closed when photodetail closed)
- Navi load happens twice (1st due to apply settings 2nd due to MainWindow_onLoad)
- shelveset problem in relation of bulkset


private Shelve GetShelve()
{
	return Context.Shelves.FirstOrDefault(s => s.Id > -1);            
}
in C:\Users\korom\source\repos\PhotoOrganizer\PhotoOrganizer\Data\Repositories\PhotoRepository.cs

scenario: select items which are closed an open (mixed) and bulk set some data
